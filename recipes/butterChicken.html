    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.</p>
    <p>The roots of butter chicken are only as recent as the 1950s, when it was developed accidentally by the chef of famous restaurant Moti Mahal in Delhi, the capital of India. For chef Kundan Lal Gujral, it was a common practice to throw in butter, tomatoes, and leftover tandoori chicken into a pot to make use of the leftovers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
